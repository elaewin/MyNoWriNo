# My Novel Write Now
## A productivity app for writers.

# What is My Novel Write Now?
My Novel Write Now's main purpose is to provide an interface for writers, or anyone working on a writing project, so that they may use it to track their progress. With many writing projects (or competitions, such as National Novel Writing Month) comes a minimum word count goal and a due date. My Novel Write Now allows the user to create a project that takes this information as input, allows the user to write in how many words they write per day for the project, and is returned their current progress as a percentage. And if granted permission by the user, My Novel Write Now can also save the project's deadline into the Calendar App so that they can be reminded of upcoming due dates.
