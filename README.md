# My Novel Write Now
## A productivity app for writers.

# What is My Novel Write Now?
My Novel Write Now provides a way writers to track their progress on writing projects, including daily word counts and the number of words required per day to reach a deadline. My Novel Write Now will also save a project's deadline to the user's calendar (via the Calendar App) so they are notified of upcoming due dates.

## Coming Soon!
* A countdown timer, including a "Do Not Disturb" option, so writers can set timed "writing sprints" in order focus on writing without distractions.
* The ability to post to social media, so users can share their progress with friends and other writers.
* More statistics, including the ability for users to track the days and times in which they are most productive.
* Google docs integration, so users who write in Google docs can update their daily word count more easily.
